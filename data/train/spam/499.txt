Everybody gets paid.  No recruiting required.

Join and reserve a position for free now.
Program is 18 weeks old and it's paying.

Everybody gets in line to get paid by all
the new people coming in (but it's NOT a
traditional straightline)...EVERYONE makes money...
and those that sponsor make more....
