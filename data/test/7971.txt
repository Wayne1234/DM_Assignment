<br>Betty Sue wasn't enjoying working.. Wasn't Dick missing talking on the street?.
<br>Until that day, he could not hear the language differences. He asked for the computer every day by pointing to it. He was allowed to spend time each day on the noun program. One year later he was talking in full sentences and was staffed into normal preschool.. I am not enjoying skiing among the trees at the moment..
