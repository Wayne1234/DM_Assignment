was marked as valuable items belonging to the family. He told me that he
deposited this USD$15 million in ending of the year 2003 and that he used=

my name as his first Child as the next of kin. And he directed me where h=
e
kept the Deposit Certificate, he further advised me to search for a relia=
ble
partner overseas who will assist me retrieve and invest the money oversea=
s

the entire family now, pending guarantee of your faithfulness and co-oper=
ation.

al

u
