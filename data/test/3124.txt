Sorry for taking so long. I finally found that site you were
asking me about. Remember, the one that I used to 
get a great  r\ate on my home   loa n? I was just looking around 
the other day and they offer    r ate s    at only 3.5 %. I am sure 
they can help you out. Please let me know how it goes.
