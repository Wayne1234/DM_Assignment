Imagine, if you can, a world in which information is disseminated as rapidly 
as it is received.  A world in which news reaches you before you even have a 
chance to wonder about it, much less speculate with your colleagues at the 
water cooler.  

A world in which the barriers to timely communication of important facts are 
erased like last month's unfiled emails.

Sounds too good to be true in "Corporate America", doesn't it?  Well, hold on 
to your hats; there's a new online publication in town.  

The dot is coming.
