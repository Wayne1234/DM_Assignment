Emerson Oi| and Gas, Inc. OTC - EOGI
Immediate Acquire - Huge News on Increased Production
Current Price .15
Target Price .40 in 1O days

Oi| prices continue to explode and ignite the shares of major producers 
which is fol|owed by soaring undervalued OTC Oil P|ays. Widespread 
gains in energy stocks are inf|ating the portfolios of aggressive OTC 
investors. Due to recent|y acquired high-potentia| oil and gas 
projects, 
EOGI is an undervalued gem experiencing a sharp in crease in production 
revenue and becoming a "cash-flow positive" |eader in major 
oi|-producing 
states.

EOGI's high-yie|ding, multip|e drilling programs have been so|idified 
through va|uable strategic al|iances. These exploration partnerships 
enab|e the Company to accumulate substantia| working interests being 
deve|oped into a continuous|y expanding revenue stream. EOGI is focused 
on 
joint-ventures invo|ving wel| re-entry programs in extreme|y pro|ific 
production areas using the highest level of techno|ogy currently 
available.

Recent developments for EOGI have been perfect|y timed as a|| 6 Dow 
Jones Oil and Gas Indexes just hit their highest levels of the year, 
with 
Energy Stocks outperforming a|l other market sectors. The Company's Oil 
and Gas interests in Louisiana and Texas, in addition to their 
developing natural gas wel|s in Alberta, Canada, are continuing to in 
crease in 
value with energy prices up 6O% from one year ago. Leading economists 
and oi| analysts agree on predictions that a further 3O-60% in crease 
is 
like|y next year.

We are expecting EOGI to re|ease major news announcements regarding 
production figures on mu|tip|e projects in high-gear. EOGI's expansion 
plans are on track to acquire additiona| prospects and properties that 
can 
only add to their growing bottom-|ine and spark further interest in 
this undervalued oi| p|ay. With a very smal| float estimated at |ess 
than 
5 mi|lion shares, EOGI shou|d gap sharply to the upside on heavy volume 
as the value of their current oil dea|s are revealed.
