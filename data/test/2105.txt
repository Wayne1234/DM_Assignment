Hello,


We sent you an email a while ago, because you now qualify
for a much lower rate based on the biggest rate drop in years.


You can now get $250,000 for as little as $515 a month!
Bad credit? Doesn't matter, low rates are fixed no matter what!


Follow this link to process your application and a 24 hour approval:
