LISTING: JAHIEL DOT NET - COMMUNITY WIRELESS NETWORK FRAMEWORK - If you can read this text, it means you are not experiencing the Plone design at its best.  Plone makes heavy use of CSS, which means it is accessible to any internet browser, but the design needs a standards-compliant browser to look like we intended it.  es and civic groups should work together to deploy community wireless networks. Beginning 4th July 2003, this site aims to provide a framework through which this can be achieved. This is a work in progress.
