Very substantial profit handling $ Judgments.

Dear Jim,

I can't thank you enough for introducting me to this business. You have
given me a fresh lease on life.  

I was terminated from a job I held for 26 years. Already earning twice as
much as I earned in my old job. Making way over my old boss's pay.  

I drive a 2005 Jaguar S Type and my old boss has an 8 year old Ford Van.
Earning at the 6 digit level in a year and a half. Having a ball in this
business. 

Its fun and yours truely a hero to the courts and to my clients.  What an
exciting profession to be in.

Doing exactly what your training tells me to do, working beautifully.  I go
to the court and locate all of the clients I can handle. I use your advanced
reporting services to locate all assets and jobs. Using your forms I send
them out to the appropriate agencies.

Then the $$ arrive to yours truely.  Its like magic.  I love it. Able to
take a holiday when ever I have a whim to do so.  Hawaii and a 1050 footer
to the Panama Canal etc. so far this year.

Please show this reference to others.  This industry so big it requires
lots of us helping the courts and the people who have been damaged.

Sincerely

George S.  Ohio

Say, you shut up! commanded the boy, angrily. If your friend was as big a
coward as you are I'd drop you both this minute
Let go my arm and keep quiet, if you want to reach land alive
