Dave:

Attached is a proposal for Firm Transportation Services that provide economic 
incentives to encourage SPS to build a lateral from the nichols Plant in 
Potter CO, Tx to our Transwestern Panhandle lateral.

As we have discussed, the proposal allows flexibility for receipt and 
delivery, yet provides rate assurance.

Thanks for your help, and if you have any questions please give me or 
Michelle a call.

Sincerly,

Bob
