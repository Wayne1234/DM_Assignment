ATTN: PRESIDENT/C.E.O

Compliment of the season.I got to know of you in search for a reputable 
and reliable person to assist me in an urgent need requiring utmost trust 
and confidentiality. 

GoodDay I am MR VICTOR OSADOLOR, the EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR  in the STANDARD TRUST BANK OF NIGERIA PLC I am writing this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out this business 
opportunity in my department. 

We discovered an abandoned sum of ($14.6million) Fourteen -Million Six Hundred Thousand Dollars Only in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer Late Mr.Robert Ebner,who died along with his entire family of a wife  and three children in October 31, 1999 in a plane crash.

Since we heard of  his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and put claims for his money as the heir, because we can not release the fund  from his account unless someone applies for the claims as the next of kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. Unfortunately, neither their family member nor distant relatives has ever appeared to claim the fund.Upon this discovery,

I and other officials in my department have agreed to make a deal with you and release the fund into your account as the NEXT OF KIN of the decease, since no one came for it or discovered the maintained account with our Bank otherwise the fund will be returned to the bankâ€˜s treasury as unclaimed fund.

Please visit http://www.greatdreams.com/PassEAir990.htm
for your confirmation of the death of The money will be paid into 
your account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and my 
colleages, and 25% for you,while 5% will be for expenses both parties 
might have incurred during the process of the transferring.

After the successful completion of this transaction,one of my 
colleaguesand I will come to your country and mind our percentage.It is 
from our share we intend to import medical equipments into my country 
as a way of recycling the fund. 

To commence this transaction, we require you to immediately indicate 
your interest if this proposal is OK. by you or you do not wish to take 
advantage of the trust we hope to bestow on you,

NOTIFICATION:THIS TRANSACTION IS 100% RISK FREE ,FOR 
YOUR INFORMATION AND ASSURANCE TO AVOID BEIGN SCARED ABOUT THE TRANSACTIONS.

I await your immediate response.

Best Regards.
MR VICTOR OSADOLOR
