All my life I've wanted to be someone; I guess I should have been more specific.	Jane Wagner/Lily Tomlin (1939- )	. Have you already loved sleeping?.

>From that day on there were new rules in my classroom. Each student was to have an adult 'communication partner' at the computer. This adult was to sit with the child, not saying a word until the student stopped and looked at the adult or in some other way indicated that communication was desired. Then the adult was only to encourage the student by saying the word, nodding the headand smiling. The student was allowed to continue his or her learning. When the student imitated a word, the adult was to respond appropriately. NO QUESTIONS WERE ALLOWED during this beginning phase. The students were just learning to talk.. The man who never makes a mistake always takes orders from one who does.	.

When all think alike, no one is thinking very much.	-Walter Lippmann (1889-1974)	. They aren't enjoying running..
