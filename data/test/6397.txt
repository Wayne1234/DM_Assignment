DEAR FRIEND,

I know this email will come to you as surprise because we have not met

before.Actually,I contacted you because I never wanted anyone known my 
family to be associated with the funds involved in this business. I am 
the first son of the late SEKO MOBUTU,the former President of the ZAIRE 
now democratic republicof congo .

I am presently on political asylum in Nigeria .

I got your contact over the internet during my search for assistance in 
this mutual transaction.this became neccessary as i do not want anybody 
known to me to be associated with this money now as we will know each 
other we make progress on this transaction.

I want you to note that this business will benefit for both of us and 
that it is 100% risk free. However, you must confirm your ability to 
handle this because it involves a large amount of money. The funds 
THIRTY SEVEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS ($37million) is my share of 
my father's estate. I boxed and shipped the money to a security company 
abroad at the peak of the a political uprising that rocked my country 
few years ago.

Now the crisis has ended , I need a trustworthy person like you to 
proceed to the place of the security company in order to clear the fund 
and afterwards, i will come to your country for us to start a joint 
business venture as i do not have the intention of bringing the funds 
back. I want The fund to be use for investment with you as partner.

Note that I will send to you the relevant documents that will enable 
you take possession of the fund for onward investment for our mutual 
benefit. 

All I need from you is as follows:

1. Your confirmation of your ability to handle this.

2.your word that you will keep this business as confidential as possible

at all times until we conclude this business.

3. Your telephone and fax numbers for communication.

4. Your full permanent address.

As soon as I get the above information from you, I will disclose to you 
the name and the country of the security company. i will also forward 
to you

the contact of the diplomat that i have hired to assist us in this 
business.i will also forward your name and particulars to the security 
company to enable them contact you accordingly. 

As we make progress, i will also send to you a LETTER OF AUTHORITY and 
AGREEMENT LETTER to enable you clear the fund on my behalf. Note that 
this is a very safe transaction as this funds is my share of my 
father's estate.

I am waiting for your response to enable us proceed.

Regards,

NZANGA JOSEPH MOBUTU.
