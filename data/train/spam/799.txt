Penis Growth Extreme

Necessity, who is the mother of invention.      
Kindness causes us to learn, and to forget, many things.   
Education is a method whereby one acquires a higher grade of prejudices. 
The prime purpose of eloquence is to keep other people from talking. 
Art washes away from the soul, the dust of everyday living.
