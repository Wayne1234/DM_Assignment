ATENTION: PLEASE.
PLEASE MAIL ON MY PRIVATE EMAIL ADDRESS:[EMAILPROTECTED:sam_mark05@walla.com]

How are you? I hope fine. How is work? I guess all right. Please I got your
email address while browsing through the net and I know you are a very reputable
person because I believe you are.
Please I want you to know that this transaction can only take place if you
agree with your heart to help me out and have no doubts nor get scared.

As you know from the mail, we want to put you in as the next of kin of the
late Engr John Creek who until his death has an account with our bank with
a closing account of us$30m and since his death nobody has come up to claim
this money from our bank.
From the information's gathered in the late Engr creek's file there is no
trace to anybody who has any blood relationship with the late Engr, this
makes us know that once there is an application from any foreigner applied
to the bank, in respect of this fund, the bank will have no alternative
than to transfer the money to the person.
For your assistance we will give you 30%, while we retain 60% and 10% will
be used to offset any bill incurred in this transaction.
If this is okay by you,please i will like you to mail me immediately on
my private email address: [EMAIL PROTECTED:sam_mark05@walla.com] so that
we can go on.
Yours faithfully,
DR. SAM.
