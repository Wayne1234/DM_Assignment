And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger? 
A man shall be commended according to his wisdom but he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised.
The merciful man doeth good to his own soul but he that is cruel troubleth his own flesh.
He will not regard any ransom neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.

<FONT style="font-size: 1px;">The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteousness.  It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones. And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?  There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.  There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword but the tongue of the wise is health.</FONT>
