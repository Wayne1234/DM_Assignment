Louise,

Looks like the $ wont show until Wednesday, then we give notice to Turbopark, wait five business days, transfer the turbines and get the $ from the escrow account.  Jake spoke directly with Hancock - they said they are done, but we have 24 hours for the escrow approval, then Hancock has a 24 hour notice period to release the funds ...hence Wednesday.
