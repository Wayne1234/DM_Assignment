        LAGOS-NIGERIA.


Dear Sir/ Madam,

I wish this proposal would not come to you as a surprise. I am Mr. Tunde 
Williams, a lawyer of international repute practicing in Nigeria. I had a 
foreign client (M/S ELINOR DUCKWORTH) an American who was a very wealthy 
contractor to many oil companies here in Nigeria. As her personal lawyer and 
confidant,I am aware that she deposited the sum of US$15.5M (Fifteen million, 
five hundred thousand United States dollars with a bank here in Nigeria 
(UNIVERSAL TRUST BANK). Unfortunately however, this lovely client of mine was 
among the victims of EGYPTAIR FLIGHT NO: 990 that crashed on the 31-10-1999 in 
the USA, which is confirmable from the CNN website: 
www.cnn.com/us/9911/02/egyptair990.list/index.html. 
Ever since her death,  and up till date we have not had anybody coming up to 
claim this money as her next of kin, a situation that I have monitored closely 
with my position as her personal lawyer. The issue right now is that the 
directors of the bank have secretly concluded arrangements to share this money 
among themselves since nobody has come forward as the next
of kin to M/S ELINOR DUCKWORTH. I do not want this to happen and we must act 
fast to stop them from carrying out their plan. I am now humbly soliciting for 
your assistance in this issue. 

I wish to present you to the bank as the next of kin of the late M/S ELINOR 
DUCKWORTH of blessed memory so as to claim this money into your account before 
it is shared by those hawks! As the personal lawyer to the late client, I have 
taken every precautionary measure concerning this issue and I have also made 
adequate arrangements in achieving this goal, provided you will follow my 
instructions in the process. Please understand that this transaction is risk 
free, as I will handle all the legal and internal documentations before you 
are presented to the bank as the next of kin to the late woman. 

All I need to proceed immediately is your assistance and support. I therefore 
request you to confirm your interest by a return message with your
full names, phone and fax numbers and I will furnish you with the full details 
and what to do concerning this deal. The percentage of what you stand to gain
would be discussed also, although it is negotiable before the deal commences.

Thank you in anticipation of your urgent response. 

Kind Regards,

Barr. Tunde Williams (SAN).
