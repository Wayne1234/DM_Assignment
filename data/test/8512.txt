Louise,

Please find attached the descriptions of all assets currently being charged to the Bridgeline Plan. I have adhered to the format that Brian Redmond used for LRC, Crawfish and Napoleonville and have changed those descriptions slightly.  I have included additional categories where relevant.  For example, "Capital Charges" identifies all assets being charged to the Bridgeline Plan.  

I will complete the descriptions for Crescendo and MEGS by tomorrow evening.

Regards, 

Jean
