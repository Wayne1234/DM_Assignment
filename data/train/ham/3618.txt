Louise,

I spoke with Mark.  I believe he is getting a little more comfortable.  He is now focused appropriately on the likelihood of the bonds getting issued.  He is going to call around to some law firms and I will talk to some Bankers, just to get some other opinions.  I will have a short presentation for the meeting.

Cheers,

Chris
