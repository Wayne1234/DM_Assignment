Louise,

I enjoyed meeting you this week and appreciate your taking the time.  The discussion with RAC on the Roseville DASH went well and hopefully it will hit your desk within two weeks.  In the meantime, we're submitting an IDASH so that we can secure options on some of the Emission Credits we'll need for the project.

Thanks again,

Mike
